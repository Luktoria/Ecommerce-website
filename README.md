## My process

### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- CSS media query for responsivity
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- React Lightbox (https://fslightbox.com) - fslightbox-react, 1.7.6


### What I learned

As this was the first project I completed with React, I improved my knowledge a lot about how different components interact with each other. I encountered numeroues things that I had to figure out for the first time ever, such as working with Lightbox or making responsive design for React. I feel like this project was a milestone for my problem-solving skills.


### Continued development

In the future I plan to perfect the layout for mobile-view. I also plan to add more products to practise reusing components that are already made.

### Useful resources

- [Lightbox](https://fslightbox.com) - Documentation for the Lightbox plug-in. 
- [Article about responsivity](https://itnext.io/3-ways-to-implement-responsive-design-in-your-react-app-bcb6ee7eb424) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand the different ways to incorporate responsivity to React. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
